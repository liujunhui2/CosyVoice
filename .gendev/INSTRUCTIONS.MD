# Instructions for project building

You task is to build a voice cloning app demo.
The outline of the final demo will be a web based voice cloning app:
- Basic user authentication (can be fixed)
- Streaming audio output
- Voice recording of reference audio
- Backend interacting with Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Transcribe

The application will be built step by step, with the requirements of each step stated in a separate REQUIREMENT-x.MD.
All the requirement MDs are placed in .gendev folder.
The requirements would probably keep updating during the building of the demo.
Only proceed to the next requirement after you are sure the previous requirements are completed.

Please suggest updating the requirement MDs if necessary.
You should record the current progress in separate MD files, e.g. TASKS.MD, preferrably in .gendev folder.

After each milestone, consider pushing the content to github
