You can test this by:\n\n1. Refreshing the web page\n2. Clicking the \"🧪 Test Log\" button to verify logging works\n3.

The audio data should be passed through correctly to the browser for playback.\n\nLet me also add a small improvement to make the WAV header check more informative:\n[Tool uses: fs_write]",

    "Perfect! I've implemented a comprehensive solution to fix the audio playback issue. Here's what I've done:\n\n## Major Audio Format Fix Applied:\n\n### 🎯 **Root Cause Identified**: \nCosyVoice API returns **raw PCM audio data** without WAV headers, which browsers cannot play directly.\n\n### 🔧 **Solution Implemented**:\n\n#### 1. **Created Audio Utilities Module** (`audio_utils.py`)\n- **`add_wav_header()`**: Adds proper WAV header to raw PCM data\n- **`detect_audio_format()`**: Analyzes audio data to determine format\n- **Configurable parameters**: Sample rate, channels, bit depth\n\n#### 2. **Enhanced CosyVoice Client**\n- **Format detection**: Automatically detects if audio is raw PCM or already has headers\n- **Automatic conversion**: Converts raw PCM to proper WAV format\n- **CosyVoice defaults**: Uses 22050Hz, mono, 16-bit (typical CosyVoice output)\n- **Comprehensive logging**: Shows conversion process step-by-step\n\n#### 3. **Improved API Routes**\n- **Format validation**: Verifies final audio is proper WAV format\n- **Enhanced debugging**: Detailed analysis of audio format at each step\n- **Better error handling**: Clear messages for format issues\n\n## Technical Details:\n\n### WAV Header Structure Added:\n```\n- RIFF chunk identifier\n- File size\n- WAVE format identifier  \n- Format chunk (PCM parameters)\n- Data chunk with raw audio\n```\n\n### Default Audio Parameters:\n- **Sample Rate**: 22,050 Hz (CosyVoice standard)\n- **Channels**: 1 (Mono)\n- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit\n- **Format**: PCM (uncompressed)\n\n### Process Flow:\n1. **Receive raw PCM** from CosyVoice API\n2. **Detect format** (raw vs. already formatted)\n3. **Add WAV header** if needed\n4. **Validate result** (ensure proper WAV format)\n5. **Serve to browser** with correct headers\n\n## Expected Results:\n\n✅ **Audio should now play properly** in browsers  \n✅ **Debug files will be valid WAV files**  \n✅ **Comprehensive logging** shows the conversion process  \n✅ **Format detection** prevents double-processing  \n\nThe system now automatically converts the raw PCM audio data from CosyVoice into proper WAV files that browsers can play. Try generating voice audio again - it should work correctly now!\n\nThe debug logs will show the conversion process, and the saved debug files should now be playable WAV files.\n[Tool uses: none]",

    "I see the issue! The `bytes` type shouldn't be imported from `typing` - it's a built-in Python type. Let me fix this import error in the audio utilities module:\n[Tool uses: fs_write]",
    "Perfect! The issue was that I incorrectly tried to import `bytes` from the `typing` module, but `bytes` is a built-in Python type that doesn't need to be imported.\n\nThe fix removes the incorrect import line:\n- ❌ `from typing import bytes` (incorrect)\n- ✅ `bytes` is used directly as a built-in type (correct)\n\nNow the audio utilities module should import correctly and the WAV header conversion should work properly. Try generating voice audio again - the import error should be resolved and the audio should play correctly with the proper WAV headers added to the raw PCM data from CosyVoice.\n[Tool uses: none]",

The issue was that there was an `else:` statement without a corresponding `if` statement, which caused the syntax error.\n\nThe code now has a clean structure:\n1. Process the audio data (add WAV header if needed)\n2. Verify the final format\n3. Return the audio data\n4. Handle exceptions properly\n\nThe syntax error should now be resolved, and the audio conversion functionality should work correctly.

  "latest_summary": "## CONVERSATION SUMMARY\n* Audio playback error resolution: CosyVoice API returns raw PCM data without WAV headers, causing browser playback failures\n* Audio format conversion implementation: Added WAV header generation to convert raw PCM to browser-compatible format\n* Logging system fixes: Implemented safe logger wrapper to handle initialization edge cases and prevent popup message boxes\n* Version 0.1.0 release preparation: Created comprehensive documentation, changelog, and version management system\n* GitHub release process: Successfully committed, tagged, and pushed complete web application to repository\n* Fine-tuning capabilities inquiry: Discussion of CosyVoice 2 container fine-tuning options and training scripts\n\n## TOOLS EXECUTED\n* fs_read: Examined audio processing code, logging system, and project documentation\n* fs_write: Created audio_utils.py module with WAV header generation functions\n* fs_write: Updated CosyVoice client to implement audio format detection and conversion\n* fs_write: Modified API routes to handle complete audio responses with proper headers\n* fs_write: Enhanced JavaScript audio handling with comprehensive debugging and validation\n* fs_write: Created version.py, CHANGELOG.md, and README_WEBAPP.md for release documentation\n* execute_bash: Executed git commands to commit, tag v0.1.0, and push to GitHub repository\n\n## CODE AND TECHNICAL INFORMATION\n* Audio format conversion: Implemented add_wav_header() function using struct.pack to create proper WAV headers for raw PCM data\n* WAV header structure: RIFF chunk identifier, file size, WAVE format, PCM parameters (22050Hz, mono, 16-bit)\n* Error handling improvements: Added try-catch blocks for binary data decoding and format validation\n* Safe logger wrapper: Created fallback mechanisms for cases where logger initialization fails\n* API response handling: Changed from StreamingResponse to complete Response with proper content headers\n* JavaScript audio validation: Added blob size checking, header inspection, and audio player event monitoring\n\n## KEY INSIGHTS GAINED\n* Root cause identification: CosyVoice API returns raw PCM audio data without browser-compatible headers\n* Format conversion necessity: Browsers require proper WAV headers to play audio, necessitating server-side conversion\n* Logging system reliability: Safe wrapper patterns prevent application failures when dependencies aren't properly initialized\n* Audio debugging approach: Comprehensive logging and file saving enables effective troubleshooting of format issues\n* Release management: Proper versioning, documentation, and changelog creation essential for maintainable projects\n* Fine-tuning capabilities: CosyVoice 2 supports SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) and flow matching training approaches",
